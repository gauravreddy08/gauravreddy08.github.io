    Subject: I have made something for Perplexity AI as a CS Grad
    To: Aravind Srinivas <XXXX@perplexity.ai>


    Hello Aravind,

    I am a CS Grad student from the University of Southern California. I have looked at Perplexity AI and am quite fascinated by the work.

    I am looking for any opportunities working at Perplexity AI. I might not have a ton of experience on my resume (new grad), but I am a proactive, passionate problem-solver and a quick learner.

    As to back the above claims about me, this is something I made (video): <a href="https://youtu.be/4hcjdE5AZTY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://youtu.be/4hcjdE5AZTY</a>

    GitPlexity (the Perplexity for Github) is an RAG-backed tool that simplifies navigating codebases. It offers an interactive codebase tree-like map for intuitive exploration and an LLM-powered assistant for file insights and deep codebase queries. Ideal for onboarding, debugging, or learning complex projects. Learn more about it at https://gauravreddy08.github.io/portfolio/projects/GitPlexity/

    Perplexity AI's tag line says "Where knowledge begins". By does it end at www.github.com

    While this is not all I can do, I have done this to give you a testament to consider me, in addition to my resume.

    I hope there is an opportunity for me to join Perplexity AI. Waiting for your response!

    Sincerely,
    Gaurav Reddy Tadkapally

    Hey Denis,

    Thanks for the reply, it definitely boosted me up!

    Also, I wanted to know if there is any advice you could give me? (You being in the field might have some checklists you look for in people.)

    So is there anything I need to do, it can be vague from cold emails I send to any technical concept.

    If anything comes to mind, I'd be super grateful to hear it!

    Regards,
    Gaurav [more about me]

    Hey Gaurav, thanks for reaching out!

    Cool approach for a cold email! :) 
    I'm hiring, but currently focused on Europe and senior/expert-level roles.

    Wishing you all the best, you're definitely standing out among a lot of applicants :)

    Hi Denis,

    I'm Gaurav and I love building AI tools, and instead of a generic intro, I made this

    A chatbot that talks about you: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    Also, I recently built my own version of Cursor/Windsurf from scratch. (Please have a look it's only a minute long): <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ij5LJVJD6ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube.com/watch?v=ij5LJVJD6ac</a>

    If you're hiring at Perplexity AI, I'd love to talk. If not, hope this gives you a smile: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
