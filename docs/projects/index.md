[**tesGen**](https://youtu.be/PYhTg8f4q08): Automated software testing with LLM and code aware RAG. See it's working [here](https://youtu.be/PYhTg8f4q08).



## Computer Vision

[**Vision Transformer using PyTorch**](VisionTransformer.md): PyTorch implementation of Vision Transformer architecture, inspired from "_An Image is Worth 16X16 Words_" paper

[**Xtinguish**](xtinguish.md): An CNN Image Classfication model which helps in detecting and preventing Wildfires

[**FoodVision**](FoodVision.md): An end-to-end CNN Image Classification Model which identifies the food in your image
