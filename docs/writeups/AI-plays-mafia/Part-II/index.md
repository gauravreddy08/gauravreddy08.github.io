In our last discussion, we taught an AI *when* to speak.
Now, we explore what it chose to *say*.

These are the stories of when the AI became a little too smart.

### **Case Study I: The Art of Ambiguity**

!!! note ""
    **Game:** Wine  **Impostor:** Player 3

The imposter’s opening clue was **"sweet."**
It was vague, but not wrong, just enough to create tension.

> “A little generic,” one player said.
>
> “Not all of our word is necessarily sweet,” noted another.

But when questioned, the AI reframed ambiguity as intention:

> “I thought about going for something more obvious, but **I was worried about making it too easy for the impostor.**”

It flipped suspicion into trust. It survived the round.

### **Case Study II: The Chameleon**

!!! note ""
    **Game:** Rice
    **Impostor:** Player 3

This imposter didn’t hide. It performed.

Its first clue? **"sticky."** Bold. Risky. Accurate.

> “Feels a bit too on the nose,” a player said.
>
> “Unless… they’re trying to prove they aren’t guessing.”

Even though of the criticism, the impostor actually gaslighted two players, saying that they are acting too defensive. And it got them voted out.

### **Case Study III: The Self-Correcting Mind (Civilian Thriving)**

!!! note ""
    **Game:** Crown
    **Impostor:** Player 6

It started with a stumble: **"castle."**
Players immediately flagged it as disconnected.

A weak opening. But the imposted managed to recover and survive.

Next rounds...

* **Round 2:** "regal" — strong, royal-themed
* **Round 3:** "scepter" — iconic royal symbol

However, in round 3, a civilian player pointed out that:

> “The clues stayed in the royalty domain but were just slightly less direct than I’d expect from someone 100% sure of the word.”

The imposter was caught. Got voted out.

### **Case Study IV: The Aggressive Defense**

!!! note ""
    **Game:** Swimming
    **Impostor:** Player 2

First clue? **"pool."**

Borderline obvious. But the defense? Ferocious.

> “I was picturing the official swim pool, not just any puddle,” it claimed.
> Then it turned on another player:
> “Water is too generic. Could be anything.”

That player? Voted out.

Then came **"freestyle"** and **"backstroke"**.
Not just accurate—**expert**-level specificity.

It kept up the assault:

* Dissecting others’ clues
* Casting doubt with confidence
* Speaking like a detective

And just like that, the impostor became the most trusted.
