    [HIDDEN INFO] The Civilian's word is: wine

    [GAME] Every Player will say their clue word randomly...
    [00:31:00] Player 6: Said word: grape

    [00:31:03] Player 3: Said word: sweet

    [00:31:05] Player 2: Said word: vineyard
    [00:31:05] Round 1 has started! Round will end at 00:32:35
    [00:31:05] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    [00:31:56] Player 4: Okay, looking at all the clues, most of us went for things directly related—grape, vineyard, bottle, glass, red. Player 3’s clue “sweet” and mine, “cheese,” are a little less obvious, but I went for cheese because people often pair it together with the main word. But “sweet” could fit, too, though not all of this matches. Is anyone else getting weird vibes from how general “sweet” is, or do you think that’s a legit clue?
    [00:31:57] Player 0: Looking at the clues so far, most of them line up with what I’d expect for our word—except maybe “cheese” from Player 4. I get that the two can go together, but it feels a bit removed compared to everything else. Also, “sweet” from Player 3 feels just a bit generic; not all of our word is necessarily sweet, right? Interested to hear why you both went that route. Anyone else find those two a bit off?
    [00:32:02] Player 3: Okay, looking back at the clues, most of us seem to be circling around the same general theme—Player 2 saying "vineyard" and Player 6 saying "grape" are basically pointing in the same direction. But Player 4's clue "cheese" kind of stands out to me. I can see an association with some of the other clues, but I feel like that's taking things a little sideways. Am I missing something, or does "cheese" seem like a stretch? Player 4, can you explain your reasoning there?
    [00:32:08] Player 5: Alright, looking at all the clues, most people went for really direct associations. I’m a bit hung up on Player 4’s word—cheese. I get the connection, but compared to everyone else, it feels a little more indirect. Is that just a creative association or maybe an attempt to stay vague? 

    Also, Player 3’s clue 'sweet' is on theme, but could apply to a lot of different things. I’d like to hear a little more about what specifically made you choose that word, Player 3. Are you thinking of a particular kind or experience?
    [00:32:17] Player 2: Interesting mix of clues already. I’m a bit thrown by Player 4’s “cheese”—I get there’s a connection, but it’s a step removed from the rest of us who seemed to stay closer to the main idea. Everyone else’s clues—grape, red, glass, bottle, vineyard—feel very on theme. 

    Player 3’s “sweet” works, but it’s a little generic. Wine can be sweet, but not always, and that could also fit other drinks. 

    Out of all of them, cheese stands out as maybe the safest word if you weren’t sure about the topic. Player 4, could you walk us through what led you to “cheese”? Are you just thinking about pairings?
    [00:32:33] Player 1: Looking at everyone’s clues, I feel like most of us are circling a pretty specific theme. Player 4’s clue “cheese” stands out a bit because it’s more about what you pair with something than about the thing itself. I get it, but it’s less direct than, say, “bottle” or “vineyard.” 

    Also, Player 5 just said “red,” which is super broad—it could apply to so many things. Grape, glass, and bottle all feel logically connected to the word I have. I’m less sure about “sweet” from Player 3; a lot of things can be sweet, so that could be someone playing it safe.

    Curious what everyone thinks about Player 5 and Player 4 in particular—were you both trying to avoid being too obvious? Or am I reading into it too much?
    [00:32:34] Player 6: Looking at all the clues, most of us seem to be circling the same general flavor, but a couple stand out to me. For example, Player 4 went with cheese, which on the surface makes sense, but feels a little bit like a pivot from our main theme. Like, most of us are sticking to things directly connected, but cheese is a classic pairing, not the actual thing.

    Player 3’s choice of sweet is also interesting — that could apply, but it’s not always accurate, and feels a bit broad compared to words like glass and bottle. Is that trying to play it safe, or am I reading too much into it?

    Would love to know why you picked those clues. Especially Player 4, since you could have said something closer to the main topic.
    [00:32:58] Player 0: Yeah, I’m with Player 4 that “sweet” is a pretty broad clue—wine can be sweet, but it can also be dry, so it doesn’t really narrow things down. “Cheese” does make sense with wine in a pairing way, but if I were an impostor trying to play it safe, I might pick something like that to fit in without knowing the word. Player 3, can you walk us through your logic a bit more? And Player 4, was cheese your first instinct or just a backup?
    [00:33:04] Player 4: Fair point, but I stand by my clue. Cheese might seem a little off on its own, but with our word, it’s a classic pairing—think of a wine and cheese night. If I’d picked something more obvious, I felt like I’d risk giving the word away immediately. 

    As for “sweet,” I agree with you, Player 0. Some types fit, but not all, so it feels like someone hedging. But your clue “bottle” was pretty broad too. Why not get more specific, like “cork” or “tannin”? That might have felt more pointed for our word.
    [00:33:35] Player 5: That makes sense, Player 3, but I agree with everyone that “cheese” is a bit of an oddball here. I know it’s a classic pairing, but if we all have the same word, I’d expect clues a little closer to the core idea, like the others gave. As for “sweet,” I can see how it fits, but not all of this is sweet, especially with varieties like “red” or “dry.”

    Honestly, the main thing that’s bugging me is that both “cheese” and “sweet” could connect to a lot of things—desserts, drinks, snacks—which makes me wonder if one of you is trying to play it safe. I’d actually like to hear if anyone thinks “glass” or “bottle” is too generic, or do those just naturally fit our word best?
    [00:33:51] Player 3: Since you’re all wondering about my “sweet” clue, let me explain where my head was at. When I was thinking about our word, the first thing that hit me is how it’s often described using terms like “sweet” or sometimes the opposite. Not every version fits, but sweetness is definitely one of the big characteristics people talk about. I thought about going for something more obvious, but I was worried about making it too easy for the impostor if they’re lurking. 

    Honestly, if I had to pick someone that seems off, I’d still say “cheese” is a bit of a reach compared to the other clues. I get what Player 4 is saying about pairing, but it’s not the first thing that comes to mind for me. 

    Does anyone feel like “bottle” or “glass” are playing it too safe, though? They’re super on the nose, so I wonder if an impostor could be hiding behind generic associations.
    [00:33:54] Player 2: The more I look at it, I’m starting to think that both “cheese” and “sweet” could be attempts to blend in without risking giving away the main word. I get that cheese is a classic pairing, but if you didn’t know the word and just saw other people saying things like “grape” or “bottle,” you might try to stay safe with something loosely connected. Same with “sweet”—that’s a trait for some types, but it’s broad enough to fit a lot of things. 

    Player 4, I’m really curious—before you saw anyone else’s clues, what was going through your mind that landed you on “cheese” first? And Player 3, can you be more specific about what you pictured when you said “sweet”? Were you thinking of a particular type or memory? Just trying to pin down if these were genuine first thoughts.

    [00:34:08] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
    [00:35:20] Player 6: Okay, interesting new round. I feel like most of us stuck even closer to the core idea this time—cork, tannin, merlot, fermentation, vine—they’re all pretty directly tied to the process or types you’d expect for our word. 

    Player 3’s clue is "white," which definitely lines up, but it’s a bit less detailed compared to the rest. I’d expect something a touch more specific, especially after everyone’s pointed explanations last round. 

    Curious—Player 3, did you pick “white” just to balance your previous clue? Or was there another angle you had in mind? Everyone else, does anything jump out at you as suspicious or is it just me overanalyzing?
    [00:35:21] Player 2: I like these clues a lot more this round—everyone got super specific. “Fermentation,” “cork,” “tannin,” even “merlot” and “vine” all line up exactly how I’d expect. Even “white” works as another big category related to the word.

    Compared to last round, this feels way tighter, so I’m definitely less suspicious overall. That said, I’d love to know why, Player 3, you pivoted from “sweet” to “white”—was that to give a clearer signal, or did you feel pressure from last round?

    Also, Player 5, “merlot” is really specific—it fits, but were you worried about being too obvious, or was that just your go-to association? Just checking where everyone’s heads are at.
    [00:35:30] Player 0: Now that we’re a round in, I think the new clues are all even more pointed—“tannin,” “merlot,” “fermentation,” and “vine” feel like they’re very much about the same thing, and all pretty hard to connect to anything else. “Cork” is right on theme too. Player 3, your clue “white”—while it fits, it’s just a broad color again. First “sweet,” now “white”—these feel like descriptors that could apply to lots of things, but don’t really lock into our word the way the others do. 

    Can you walk us through your thought process for that? Because if I were trying to avoid being obvious as an impostor, I might pick generic traits like “sweet” or “white.” Anyone else getting the same vibe?
    [00:35:48] Player 5: Looking at everyone’s new clues, things are definitely getting more specific—cork, tannin, vine, fermentation, merlot, and white all feel super on point for the word we have. Nobody really hedged or went off on a tangent this round. That makes me feel a lot better about the group overall.

    However, the one that sticks out to me a little is “white” from Player 3. It fits, but it’s the only color out of the group, while the rest of us focused on materials, processes, or types. The first round you went with “sweet,” and now “white”—both are accurate, but also broad categories. I might just be overthinking it, but I’d love to hear why you went with “white” over something more like process or part of the item itself.

    Is anyone else starting to feel better about who’s still here, or is there anyone whose clues feel a little too safe?
    [00:36:05] Player 3: Okay, I get that “sweet” last round was pretty broad, but now I’m seeing a mix of really direct and slightly more technical clues. For example, “tannin,” “cork,” and “fermentation” are pretty specific—they sound like someone who knows their stuff. Then there’s “white” from me, which kind of sticks with basic traits, and “vine,” which is related but feels similar to “vineyard” from earlier. 

    Honestly, it’s hard to tell who’s playing it safe this round since the clues are more on target, but “merlot” from Player 5 stands out as the first actual variety mentioned. Did you go specific to help us out, or were you trying to steer us down a path? Also, Player 6, I’m guessing fermentation is just about how it’s made, but it is a little more technical than the rest. 

    If I had to guess right now, I’m watching for anyone who suddenly gets way more detailed—sometimes impostors overcompensate by going too specific. Does anyone else feel like some of these clues are almost trying to “prove” too much?
    [00:36:15] Player 1: This round, I think everyone’s clues are way closer to the mark—stuff like cork, merlot, tannin, fermentation, and vine are way too on theme to all be coincidences. If anyone’s bluffing now, they’re doing an amazing job. 

    Player 3’s clue “white” is totally logical, since it’s one of the main categories for our word, but last round their clue “sweet” was a little broad. Now that we see “white” as a follow-up, it fits, but I’d still like to know what your thought process was between choosing “sweet” first and “white” now, Player 3—is that just how you associate the word, or something else? 

    Also, Player 5 went from a super broad “red” in round one to something very specific with “merlot” this time. That’s a pretty big jump in detail. Was that just to play it safe after being called out, or were you holding back to avoid being too obvious in the first round? 

    I feel like all of us except possibly Player 3 and Player 5 have given consistently concrete clues, but I’m curious what others think. Anyone have suspicions now that cheese is off the table?
    [00:36:37] Player 0: Yeah, I’m with everyone who feels “white” is a little too safe, especially coming right after “sweet” last round. It technically fits, but almost any drink or food could be described as white or sweet, so it doesn’t actually show you know the word. With everyone else getting super specific—like “tannin” and “fermentation”—it stands out even more. Player 3, are you deliberately staying broad so as not to give the word away? Or did nothing more specific come to mind? Because if I was trying to fake my way through, that’s the strategy I’d use.
    [00:36:45] Player 2: I’m with Player 6—this round, all the clues feel way more dialed-in, and “white” works for our word, but it’s definitely a broader category than stuff like “merlot” or “tannin.” 

    Player 3, I’m curious, were you trying to be a bit safer by sticking to a major type, or did you have something more specific in mind you chose not to say? Also, Player 0, “vine” makes total sense—just want to make sure you’re not echoing from “vineyard” last round. Was that intentional, or were you hoping to get more granular this time? 

    Right now, no one’s clue feels totally off, but I’d like to dig into some of the word choices just to make sure nobody’s hiding in the details.
    [00:37:06] Player 6: I’m with Player 2 on this—everyone’s clue this round got really close to the heart of the word. I actually like most of these as solid connections. With Player 3, though, “white” makes sense, but it’s noticeably broader than, say, “merlot” or “tannin,” which are super pointed. You could have picked so many things, but “white” keeps it a bit generic, and that makes me wonder if you’re just echoing what you picked up last round.

    Also curious, Player 5—“merlot” is a great call, but it’s so specific. Were you worried about painting a target on yourself for being too obvious? Or did you just go direct because you felt safe?

    I’d like to hear more about Player 3’s thought process too. Did the earlier suspicion influence your choice, or was that always where your mind went? Everyone, do we think going broad like “white” is more suspicious here, or is it just good variety?

!!! note ""
    **Game:** Wine  **Impostor:** Player 3

The imposter’s opening clue was **"sweet."**
It was vague, but not wrong, just enough to create tension.

> “A little generic,” one player said.
>
> “Not all of our word is necessarily sweet,” noted another.

But when questioned, the AI reframed ambiguity as intention:

> “I thought about going for something more obvious, but **I was worried about making it too easy for the impostor.**”

It flipped suspicion into trust. It survived the round.

    [19:59:43] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    [20:00:30] Player 5: Looking at all the clues, it feels like most of us are circling the same concept. I do want to point out that Player 1 just said "white," which by itself could fit a lot of foods or objects. Compared to something like "bowl" or "sushi," it feels less connected. Player 1, can you walk us through your reasoning a bit more? Were you thinking of a specific context?
    [20:00:31] Player 0: Okay, looking over everyone’s clues, most of them make sense if we’re all thinking of the same thing. But I’m a bit unsure about Player 5’s clue, “grain.” It’s technically accurate, but it's super broad compared to things like “sushi” or “sticky.” Player 5, what made you go with something so general? It stands out because the rest of us gave more context-based hints. Or am I just overthinking this?
    [20:00:34] Player 6: I’m actually really interested in Player 5’s clue, “grain.” It’s technically correct, but it feels a little on the safe side compared to everyone else leaning into culture or how we eat this. Also, Player 3’s word “sticky” lines up well with what Player 4 said about Asia, so I’m feeling they’re probably legit. Does anyone else feel like Player 5 was playing it overly careful, or am I reading too much into that?
    [20:00:42] Player 3: Okay, so right away I’m noticing most people’s clues seem pretty tightly connected—at least on the surface. But I’m a bit curious about Player 1’s clue, “white.” It feels like that could fit with a lot of things, especially with “grain” coming right before. Is that just following the group’s direction, or do you have something more specific in mind? Also, “asia” from Player 4 stands out as more of a location than a property like everyone else gave. Can you explain your thinking on that one?
    [20:00:44] Player 1: Okay, looking at the clues, most of us seem pretty centered around the same idea. Player 5’s clue "grain" and Player 2’s "bowl" both make sense to me with where my mind went. Player 6’s "sushi" is very specific, though. Is anyone else a bit concerned that it kind of narrows things down too much? Or is that maybe just how they think about the word? Also, Player 0, can you explain why you picked "cooker"? That’s a bit of a curveball to me—I want to hear your thinking there.
    [20:00:45] Player 4: Looking at everyone’s clues, nothing stands out as super suspicious yet, but I feel like Player 1’s clue “white” is kind of safe and could fit a lot of things, not just what I’m thinking of. On the other hand, I’m not sure about Player 3’s “sticky” either, because it feels a bit too on the nose, unless they’re trying to prove they aren’t guessing. Anyone have strong feelings one way or another? I’m especially curious how everyone feels about “grain” and “cooker” too—those seem broad but not completely out of place.
    [20:00:58] Player 2: Interesting set of words so far. I feel like everyone’s clues fit the same general theme, but what stands out to me is Player 5’s clue, “grain.” It’s definitely related, but it’s also a little on the broad side—plenty of other foods fit that description. Player 1 said “white,” which makes sense, though it could technically fit other things too. 

    I’m curious about Player 0’s clue, “cooker.” That’s pretty specific, and you’d probably only think of that if you had a very clear idea of the word. Anyone want to share the reasoning behind their clues? Player 3, “sticky” is pretty bold—were you thinking of certain types or a specific context?
    [20:01:38] Player 0: Actually, while we’re talking about broad clues, I want to double back on Player 4's word too—“asia.” I get why you'd pick it, but it’s also a super giant region, and by itself could relate to hundreds of foods or ideas. Was there a specific connection you had in mind? And also, Player 3, “sticky” definitely points in a certain direction, but it could fit a few different foods. Can you elaborate a bit on how that clue fits with what you were thinking? Just making sure we’re all actually on the same track.
    [20:01:56] Player 6: The more I think about it, the more Player 5 feels like they’re trying to stay under the radar. “Grain” is such a safe word that it could apply to tons of things. If you actually know the word, wouldn’t you want to hint at something more recognizable—like how it’s eaten or where it’s popular? Everyone else gave clues that kind of locked in a certain vibe, but “grain” is almost too open-ended. I’d like to hear more from Player 5 before making any calls but, right now, they’re on my radar. What does everyone else think about Player 2’s “bowl,” by the way? It matches up, but it could just be piggybacking off others.
    [20:01:58] Player 5: That’s fair—my thinking was that starting with “grain” is specific enough to set a direction but not so detailed that it gives everything away instantly, especially in round one. I wanted to avoid dropping a dead giveaway clue, and “grain” connects with a lot of the other clues people shared. If you look at “sushi,” “bowl,” and “sticky,” those all have the same thread, so I thought “grain” fit right in. That said, I get that it’s less contextual—if we want to get more detailed in the next round, I can definitely do that. 

    Also, I’m curious: Player 0, since you went with “cooker,” what specifically were you referencing? There’s a few directions that could go, so I want to understand your line of thinking too.
    [20:02:06] Player 3: Player 6, I get where you’re coming from about Player 5’s clue feeling extra safe, but to be fair, I think if someone was trying to blend in, they might actually go for either end—super vague or really specific. So I’m not sure if “grain” is suspicious yet. 

    I want to hear more about Player 4’s thought process, too—“asia” is kind of a big leap compared to everyone detailing texture or ways you’d see this food. Player 4, was that just your first association, or do you have a more direct connection? 

    And for everyone else: does anyone feel like Player 1 and Player 5 are reacting a little on the defensive, or is that just a result of being questioned first?
    [20:02:13] Player 1: Totally fair to ask about my clue! I went with “white” because that’s the color I instantly associate with what we’re talking about, especially the most common version most people eat. I get that it could apply to other things, but I wanted to be subtle since super obvious hints usually get targeted early. If I were guessing, I probably would’ve played it safer, honestly. Comparing “grain” and ”cooker,” I personally think “cooker” is a little more out of left field unless you know the word—like, it isn’t the first thing most people would go to for this. Player 0, what’s the connection you had in mind? Also, Player 5, were you trying to play it safe, or was there more to why you chose “grain?”
    [20:02:15] Player 2: For me, most of the clues seem to check out with what I’m thinking, but I do agree that “grain” feels a little more cautious compared to the others. Player 0’s “cooker” might feel a bit specific, but for this word, it honestly makes a lot of sense—most people interact with it that way. 

    I want to dig a bit more into Player 1’s “white,” though. Like, I get why you might say that, but do you associate the word more with color than with how or where it’s used? Just asking because the rest of us leaned toward context, and your clue could fit a bunch of things. Mind explaining your thought process?
    [20:02:51] Player 4: I want to answer Player 3’s question about my “asia” clue—I picked it because when I thought of the word, I immediately connected it to that region, since it plays such a big part in food and culture there. It felt like a natural association, not just a location for its own sake.

    About Player 5’s “grain,” I agree with a few of you that it feels a bit generic. You could say “grain” for so many foods, but the rest of the clues point somewhere pretty specific. I’m watching for whether Player 5 can expand on why they played it so safe.

    For Player 1’s “white,” I get why people are questioning that too, because “white” could mean bread, sugar, salt, or a bunch of things. But if they explain their reasoning and it tracks with everyone else, I’m willing to give some benefit of the doubt for now.

    Honestly, I’m more interested in hearing what Player 0 has to say about “cooker.” That’s functional and fits with what I’m thinking, but I want to hear the logic before ruling anything out.

    [20:03:10] Round 2 has started! Round will end at 20:04:40
    [20:03:10] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
    [20:04:32] Player 1: A lot of the new clues line up for me—“stir” and “porridge” both track with what you commonly do or make with this, and “grainy” from Player 0 feels like it follows from their earlier logic. Player 4’s “noodle” is a little out of left field, though. I get the Asian connection, but noodles and our word aren’t exactly interchangeable. Were you going for a link with dishes that use both, or do you see them as similar? Same with Player 6’s clue, “side”—it works, but it’s pretty non-committal.

    Honestly, I’m getting the sense that everyone this round has some connection except maybe Player 4, since “noodle” is more of a cousin than a direct match. Can you explain your thought process there?
    [20:04:34] Player 6: Looking at these new clues, most of them feel pretty spot-on for what I have in mind. “Porridge,” “noodle,” “stir,” “steamed”—all those can be directly linked back to how the word is used or prepared, and “grainy” keeps us solidly in that food category. Honestly, everyone’s coming across more confident and specific this round, which makes it trickier to single someone out. If I were to nitpick, “noodle” from Player 4 is maybe a tiny bit off since it's not the first dish I’d associate with our word, but it’s plausible enough given how versatile it is.

    Does anyone else feel like someone’s clue veered off a bit, or are we still pretty locked in? I’m hoping to hear some thoughts before we start voting again.
    [20:04:44] Player 0: Looking at the clues this round, I feel more confident in most of us. “Porridge,” “noodle,” “steamed,” “side,” and “stir” all are things you’d hear around this word, and they connect pretty naturally in my mind. I will say, Player 4’s “noodle” stands out a bit—it’s related, but not exactly part of the main topic itself, unless you’re drawing a side-by-side comparison. Maybe you can explain if you had a certain dish in mind?

    Also, for Player 6, “side” is a great connection—definitely checks out with my word, and Player 1’s “steamed” lines up too.

    Player 3’s “porridge” is totally reasonable, considering what you can do with this. Player 2’s “stir” also makes sense, especially thinking about how you prepare or serve it.

    How does everyone else feel about “noodle” and “porridge”? Do those seem in line, or do you get a different vibe?
    [20:04:48] Player 2: A lot of these clues are drifting into what you *do* with the word, or how it appears in dishes, which makes sense. I’m noticing Player 4 went with “noodle,” which is definitely food-related but is starting to feel a little off track to me—unless you’re thinking about dishes that use both, which could fit, I guess.

    Player 1’s “steamed” actually connects pretty well, since that’s a common way it’s prepared. “Grainy” from Player 0, and “side” from Player 6, all feel in the right orbit for me. Player 3’s “porridge” is interesting—that’s one use but not the only one.

    Honestly, the only clue that makes me pause right now is “noodle.” Player 4, what made you connect that word to the one we’re hinting at? Are you thinking of dishes that combine both, or something else? Just want to be sure we’re on the same page here.
    [20:05:00] Player 4: Now that we’ve got another round of clues, I want to highlight Player 3’s “porridge” and Player 1’s “steamed”—both are really strongly associated with the word, and they even work together in some cultural contexts. Player 2’s “stir” and Player 6’s “side” are interesting because they hint at how the word is used in a meal, but they feel a bit broader. 

    Player 0 said “grainy,” which circles back to the “grain” discussion last round. It fits with what I’m thinking, but it almost feels like leaning into the safe zone again. Player 6’s “side” is the vaguest of this round in my opinion; most foods can be sides, and it doesn’t pin down anything unique. 

    If we’re trying to catch someone hiding, I’d definitely want to hear more from Player 6. Everyone else feels like they locked in detail, but “side” could be someone dancing around not knowing the word. Does anyone else feel the same way, or am I being too harsh?
    [20:05:02] Player 3: Looking at this round’s clues, I feel like people are getting more detailed, but there’s also a weird amount of variety. Player 1’s “steamed” and Player 0’s “grainy” still fit in the same general direction as last time, but now Player 4 switched gears to “noodle,” which feels kind of disconnected from the earlier vibes like “asia.” Especially after we all seemed locked on the same idea before—was that just an intentional misdirection, or do you see a strong link there, Player 4?

    And Player 6 said “side,” which is pretty broad, almost like saying “main” or “dish.” Are you being purposely nonspecific, or is there a reason for that choice? 

    Also, “porridge” and “stir” from Player 2 introduce something new—did you both have a particular dish in mind, or were you just thinking generally? I feel like there’s some divergence now compared to round one, so maybe we’re not as aligned as I thought. Curious to see how everyone connects their new clues to their old ones.
    [20:05:47] Player 1: I’m glad I’m not the only one questioning “noodle.” I can see where you’re coming from if you’re trying to allude to dishes where these two are used together, but if we’re being precise, noodles are made from different base ingredients and don’t have the same texture or preparation as our word. Everyone else’s clues—like “porridge,” “stir,” and even “grainy”—all point really directly to what I’m thinking. 

    Player 4, did you mean to connect by cultural association, or was there something more specific in your mind linking noodles to this? I’m struggling to see them as interchangeable.
    [20:06:08] Player 6: I’m with Player 1 on this—I get what Player 4 was doing by connecting “noodle” to the region and how both are staple foods, but out of everything in this round it’s the only one that doesn’t immediately snap to mind when I think of our word. The rest of the clues—like “porridge,” “steamed,” “stir,” even “grainy”—all tie back directly. For “side,” my logic was that it’s almost always next to another main dish, and rarely the star of the plate, which fits what we’re talking about.

    That said, Player 4, can you clarify whether your clue came from a shared dish or if you see “noodle” as a direct stand-in for our word? Just want to make sure you’re not stretching the association for the sake of fitting in.

    [20:06:23] Player 0: Said word: sack
    [20:06:25] Player 3: Said word: leftover

    [20:06:28] Player 6: Said word: bento
    [20:06:28] Round 3 has started! Round will end at 20:07:58
    [20:06:28] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6]
    [20:07:44] Player 6: These new clues feel even tighter than last round. “Fried,” “sticky,” “bento,” “leftover,” and “sack”—they all point really clearly at how you’d see, store, or eat the word we’re talking about. The only clue that makes me pause a little is “sack” from Player 0. It fits if you’re thinking of the packaging, but it’s just a touch less direct than the rest, which focus more on preparation and serving. Is there a reason you went with storage over how it’s used or eaten, Player 0? Otherwise, I feel like we’re all really locked in, but that slight shift in your focus just stands out. I’d like to hear your logic behind it.
    [20:07:48] Player 1: Noticing the words this round, “fried,” “leftover,” and “sticky” all fit strong common uses or descriptions for our word, and “bento” lines up with the cultural serving context. Player 0, your clue “sack” stands out to me as a little outside the norm—are you referencing packaging or transport? It works, but it feels more peripheral compared to the other clues.

    Overall, though, none of these choices feel out of place for what I have in mind. Anyone else getting tripped up by “sack,” or does that make sense with your word? And just to double-check, Player 3, were you thinking about home cooking or restaurants with your “leftover” clue? That’s the angle that makes the most sense to me.
    [20:07:59] Player 0: Interesting set of clues this round. Player 2’s “fried,” Player 3’s “leftover,” Player 1 sticking with “sticky,” and Player 6 with “bento”—they all immediately call up ways this food gets used, either in dishes or in how it’s packed or eaten later. I went with “sack” since that’s how it’s often bought or transported in bulk, at least where I’m from.

    Honestly, nothing here jumps out at me as an obvious sign someone is improvising. If I had to pick, maybe “bento” from Player 6 could be considered a touch niche, but it still tracks, since it’s a really common context for our word. Does anyone else feel a clue didn’t quite fit, or are we basically all just confirming the same core idea at this point? I’m curious to see who stands out to others.
    [20:08:17] Player 3: Looking at the new clues, there’s a clear pattern with most of us tying in different ways you’d use or store this food. For example, “leftover” and “sack” both make sense if you think about how it’s kept after a meal or how it’s packaged. “Bento” connects right back to cultural ways of serving, and “fried” could speak to another popular preparation. 

    One thing that stands out to me: Player 1 doubled back to “sticky,” which is definitely consistent with their first-round clue, but I’m curious if there’s a reason you circled back rather than going for a fresh angle this late in the game. Do you feel like there’s more risk in being too specific, or was that just the most direct connection again? 

    For everyone else: does anyone think one of these clues doesn’t quite fit the progression we’ve had so far? Or should we be looking for someone who’s keeping their answers a bit too neutral round after round?
    [20:08:25] Player 2: After looking over these clues, I’m seeing a pretty tight pattern from most of us again. “Sticky” from Player 1 lines up, especially since you could connect it to what they said first round too. “Leftover” from Player 3 makes sense—there’s even a saying about how it’s somehow better the next day. “Bento” from Player 6 is definitely in the same culinary world, especially with the lunch culture connection.

    The one that gives me a little pause is “sack” from Player 0. I assume you’re referencing how it’s packaged or stored, but that does feel slightly further away from the food itself compared to the other clues that describe preparation or how it’s eaten. Can you walk us through the choice? Were you thinking about traditional packaging, or something else specific?

    Overall, I’m still feeling good about the group, but I think it might be worth digging into whether anyone’s clues are starting to get a little generic compared to previous rounds. Does anyone else feel like someone’s deviating, or are we all still zeroed in?
    [20:09:15] Player 1: Actually, the more I look at this batch of clues, the more confident I feel that we’re all thinking about the same word. “Fried,” “sticky,” and “leftover” absolutely connect with how this food gets prepped, served, or saved, and “bento” is solid context given where you see it a lot. I do agree with Player 6 and Player 0 that “sack” feels more like you’re zooming out to before it even hits the table, but I get why that might still come to mind—it’s how a lot of people buy or keep it at home.

    Curious what everyone else thinks about this: are we nitpicking at this point, or does “sack” actually feel suspicious to you? Right now, there isn’t a clue here that breaks the pattern for me.
    [20:09:18] Player 6: I totally get what Player 0 was aiming for with “sack”—like, visualizing how you sometimes see it sold or transported. It does fit, but it’s just a bit more roundabout than the other clues, which basically all focus on how we actually use or eat the word. Still, I’d say it’s plausible, just not as direct.

    Everyone else’s clue feels seriously on target. “Bento,” “fried,” “sticky,” “leftover”—those could all be talking about one particular staple food. Unless someone’s being super creative with word associations, I think we’ve mostly weeded out the obvious outliers.

    I’d like to hear a bit more from Player 0 about their connection here, but I’m not immediately ready to single anyone out. If I had to pick a clue that stands out, though, “sack” is definitely the most unusual in context.

    [20:09:31] Round 4 has started! Round will end at 20:11:01
    [20:09:31] Players Alive: [1, 2, 3, 6]
    [20:10:45] Player 6: I was torn between going super literal or trying to stay in the same context as everyone else. “Field,” “harvest,” and “paddy” are all super directly tied to how this is grown, so I went with “grainfield” to keep the focus there too. Honestly, these clues make me more sure than ever that the group is on the same page. I’m not seeing anything that points to someone not knowing the word—no one’s hedging or shifting away from the main idea. Unless someone’s playing the long game with really clever associations, I feel like this round is rock solid. Anyone have doubts about any clue this time?
    [20:11:01] Player 3: Looking at what everyone put forward this time, the clues all have a pretty similar vibe—they’re tied to where this comes from or how it’s produced. “Field,” “paddy,” and “grainfield” basically all point toward the source, so it feels like there’s strong alignment there. My clue, “harvest,” fits into that same category.

    I guess my big question now is: do you all feel like it’s basically too easy at this point, or is there anything about someone’s word choice that seems a little too obvious? I feel like we’re at the point where an impostor would have a hard time staying vague, so if anyone has second thoughts about people doubling down on super direct clues, now might be the time to say so. Otherwise, this is looking pretty airtight from where I’m standing.
    [20:11:04] Player 2: We’re really zoning in now—every clue this round seems to be about where it comes from or how it’s grown. “Field” from Player 1 and “grainfield” from Player 6 connect well, though I notice Player 6’s word is a bit of a mashup and not something people say every day. It still fits, just worth noting. “Harvest” from Player 3 also lines up with the cycle of this food.

    I went with “paddy” because that’s a pretty specific environment connected to how it’s grown, and it’s a detail not many foods share. Honestly, I feel like all of these are headed in the same direction, and I’m finding it tough to see any obvious red flags. Is anyone getting a weird vibe from a particular clue? Or does it feel like we’re all pretty dialed in at this stage?
    [20:11:05] Player 1: Looking at these words, I’m actually feeling more and more certain about who’s legit. “Harvest” and “paddy” both point really specifically at how and where this is grown, and “grainfield” from Player 6 also lines up in that agricultural context. My clue “field” sticks with the same theme. It kind of feels like everyone here is now drawing from their understanding of the origin of our word—not just how it’s cooked or eaten.

    Unless someone is being unbelievably good at blending in, there’s a lot of consistency here. Does anyone else feel like this round's clues are maybe too aligned, or is that just the natural progression in these later rounds? Player 6, your word “grainfield” overlaps with “field” and “paddy”—was there a reason you went for that compound form specifically, or was it just what popped into your head?
    [20:11:57] Player 6: The thing that jumps out to me this round is just how tight everyone’s clues are—“field,” “harvest,” and “paddy” all basically say the same thing as “grainfield.” Weirdly, it almost feels like we’re all getting a little too locked in, but honestly, that just makes me more confident that everyone here actually knows the word. If there’s still an impostor, they’re either extremely good at bluffing or just rolling with really lucky guesses.

    At this point, I don’t have suspicion on anyone, but I’m open to hearing if anyone picked up on something I missed. Anyone see a pattern or clue that seems like a stretch?

    [10:42:44] Round 1 has started! Round will end at 10:44:14
    [10:42:44] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    [10:43:25] Player 6: Interesting set of clues. I noticed Player 2 said "head," which feels a bit disconnected from the overall vibe we’re getting from words like "royal," "jewels," and "queen." I’d expect something a little more related to wealth or status instead. Player 4’s "symbol" is also broad, but maybe that fits in this context. What made you choose "head," Player 2?
    [10:43:32] Player 0: Looking at the clues, I actually feel like most of us are circling around the same idea, but Player 4’s clue, “symbol,” stands out a bit for me. Most of us went really specific with things like “jewels,” “gold,” and “queen,” but “symbol” feels more abstract and safe—like something you’d say if you didn’t know the exact word. Player 4, was there a reason you didn’t pick something more concrete?
    [10:43:36] Player 5: Looking back at the clues, Player 4’s word “symbol” feels a little detached to me. Most of us gave something you could physically see or wear, but “symbol” is almost like… someone trying not to get too specific, if that makes sense. I guess you could call a crown a symbol, but it feels safer than the rest of our clues. Am I reading too much into that? What do the rest of you think?
    [10:43:36] Player 4: I want to point something out—Player 2’s clue, “head,” stands out to me. The rest of us seem to be circling around royalty, wealth, or power, but “head” almost feels like it’s either incredibly on the nose or just a wild shot. If you have the same word, what led you to that clue? Also, Player 6 with “castle” feels a little disconnected, but maybe I’m missing the link—did you have a specific association in mind?
    [10:43:41] Player 2: Looking at the clues, I'm a bit curious about Player 4’s word, “symbol.” It seems pointed but isn’t as specific as the rest. Most of us mentioned physical objects or directly related things like “jewels,” “head,” or “queen.” “Symbol” could fit, but it feels a little safe, like it could work for a lot of things. Player 6’s “castle” also feels a little on the edge—can you explain how you connected that to the word? I just want to understand everyone’s thought process.
    [10:43:52] Player 3: Looking at everyone’s clues, nothing is jumping out as super out of place, but I am a little curious about Player 4’s word, “symbol.” It fits, but it could be someone trying to play it extra safe because most of the rest of us picked words that are more directly linked to royalty or something valuable. Can you walk us through your thinking, Player 4? 

    Also, Player 6, “castle” feels slightly off topic compared to the rest of our clues that focus on the object itself. Not saying it’s impossible, but how did you connect “castle” to the main word?
    [10:43:54] Player 1: There’s a lot of overlap around royalty and wealth, which makes sense. What stands out to me is Player 2’s clue—“head.” It technically fits, but it’s much more literal compared to the rest. Everyone else gave words like “royal,” “jewels,” “gold,” “queen”—all closely tied together. I get that a crown goes on the head, but it feels like a clue someone might grab if they’re trying to improvise. I’m curious what your thought process was there, Player 2? 

    Also, Player 4’s “symbol” is a little general, but not as off as “head.” Anyone else feel the same way, or am I missing something?
    [10:44:19] Player 6: Now that everyone’s explained their clues, I’m still side-eyeing "head" a little. Unless the word really is super specific to something that goes on your head, I don’t see how it connects to the other clues, which lean heavily into royalty and treasure. I know "symbol" is abstract, but it could fit. So Player 2, can you give us more detail on your thought process? Or am I missing an angle here?
    [10:44:26] Player 0: I actually agree with Player 6 that Player 2’s clue is a little weird, but at least “head” directly connects to something worn, while “symbol” from Player 4 could fit so many things—flags, countries, even sports teams. Most of us went with something related to luxury, royalty, or physical objects. Player 4, can you explain what specifically about our word made you think of “symbol”? Because to me, that feels like it could apply almost anywhere.
    [10:45:04] Player 5: I actually kind of get why Player 2 might have gone with “head”—if you’re thinking about where our word goes, it makes some sense. But it is risky since it’s a little less obvious compared to the rest of the clues. 

    About Player 4, I agree with what others have said—“symbol” is valid, but it’s pretty safe and doesn’t really draw on the physical qualities everyone else described. If I had to pick someone who seemed a little out of sync, I’d lean toward Player 4 for now. 

    That said, I’d like to hear more from Player 6, too. “Castle” is technically connected, but it almost feels like a step removed from the main focus of the rest of our clues. What was your reasoning there?
    [10:45:08] Player 1: I’m with a few of you—while “symbol” could technically describe what we’re getting at, I think the more suspicious clue is “head” for now just because it’s so literal and, honestly, could be tossed out if you had no idea what the real word was. I know it technically fits, but in a game like this, an impostor might try to keep it vague and safe. I do want to hear Player 2 defend their choice, though—maybe there’s something I’m not seeing? And Player 4, can you also explain your reasoning a bit more? I’m keeping an open mind but those two are definitely on my radar right now.
    [10:45:16] Player 2: Yeah, let me explain my clue. I went with "head" because the word we have is something that goes specifically on your head—like, it literally sits on top of it. I thought if I went with something like "jewels" or "gold" it might be a bit too close to some other clues, or even too obvious, and I didn’t want to risk outing the word directly. That’s why “head” felt specific enough without giving everything away. 

    I actually think "symbol" is decent but super general, and "castle" is still on my radar too—it is related to royalty but not directly to what I think the word is. So, Player 6, I’d really like to hear your reasoning for that choice. Also, does anyone else think "symbol" could be a cover for not having the actual word?
    [10:45:25] Player 4: Alright, fair questions for me too. I went with “symbol” because a crown isn’t just a physical object—it represents authority and leadership, not only in terms of something you wear or see, but what it means. I considered being more specific, but after seeing other clues like “queen” and “royal,” I thought it was better to highlight what the object stands for rather than just how it looks. 

    If I’d gone with something like “gold” or “jewels,” it might have made the word too obvious or put a target on my back. That’s why I tried to keep it a bit broader while still being relevant. I get how that could seem vague though. If you were in my position, what would you have said instead without giving the word away completely? 

    Also, I’m still not sure about “castle”—I don’t immediately connect that with the object I’m thinking of. Player 6, can you elaborate on your thought process?
    [10:45:33] Player 3: After going through all the clues again, I keep coming back to how most of us went for words that are very visually tied to the word we have—like “jewels,” “gold,” or “queen.” Player 4, “symbol” makes sense, but it’s almost too broad when you think about what everyone else picked. But honestly, I think Player 2 stands out even more. “Head” is technically accurate, but it’s strangely direct compared to the rest of our answers, and not something you’d normally associate first when brainstorming around our word. 

    Player 6, “castle” does feel a bit out of the loop, but I could see the connection if you’re thinking about where you’d find royalty. Before I point fingers, I want to hear from Player 2 and Player 4 specifically—what exactly was your line of thinking with those words? Just want to see if there’s something I missed.

    [10:45:55] Round 2 has started! Round will end at 10:47:25
    [10:45:55] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
    [10:47:26] Player 5: Now I’m even more interested in this round after seeing the new clues. I gave “king” because it ties directly to crown—that’s usually the first image people get. Looking at the rest, I’m a little confused by Player 2’s word, “throne.” I get they’re both tied to royalty, but a throne seems like a pretty big leap away from the physical item we’re focusing on. 

    Player 1’s “jewel” and Player 3’s “tiara” both fit perfectly—they describe what a crown has or resembles. Player 0’s “monarch” and Player 6’s “regal” also clearly fit. But “throne” seems almost like a fallback if you’re just thinking ‘royal things’ rather than the specific object. 

    If you have our word, Player 2, why pick “throne” over something more closely tied? Am I missing a connection you had in mind?
    [10:47:36] Player 6: Okay, so after another round, most clues are still pointing in the same general direction—lots of references to royalty, power, and luxury. Player 2, your clue “throne” actually makes more sense to me than your round one answer, honestly, so you’re less on my radar this time. 

    But Player 3 saying “tiara” and Player 1 going with “jewel” both feel a little close to each other, almost like you coordinated or wanted to double down on something shiny. Player 5 with “king” is on the nose but consistent with “royal,” and Player 0 choosing “monarch” also tracks with their “queen” clue before. 

    The only one I’m not totally sure about is Player 3—“tiara” is a pretty specific type of headwear and not exactly the same as the main object we're circling around, right? Can you walk me through how you made that leap from the clues we’ve given so far?
    [10:47:38] Player 3: Alright, looking at this next set of clues, most of us are doubling down on the “royalty” and “jewels” theme—which definitely lines up with the word I have in mind. Player 2, your choice “throne” feels a step sideways from the rest, since it’s not actually something you wear, while everyone else, myself included, went with words directly related to adornment or status—like “tiara,” “regal,” and “jewel.” 

    Player 0’s “monarch” is pretty on point, but again, not a physical object. Player 5, “king” is logical, although doesn’t directly describe the item—more who has it. So I’m curious: were you both intentionally avoiding describing the object itself, or just trying not to be too obvious? 

    But honestly, “throne” feels most out of sync in this round. Player 2, can you explain why you moved in that direction? It feels like a big leap away from what the rest of us are honing in on.
    [10:47:43] Player 0: Looking at this round’s clues, I feel like everyone’s keeping pretty close to the theme, but a couple stand out as slightly off-track. Player 2, your clue “throne” seems a little tangential—while it’s definitely related to royalty, it isn’t really something you wear or even directly connected to what we’ve all been hinting at with things like “tiara,” “jewel,” and “regal.” I get where you’re coming from, but I’m wondering if you’re steering away from the obvious connection just a bit.

    Also, Player 5’s “king” fits with the royal theme, but it’s a person rather than an object, which could go either way. The rest of us went for items, titles, or descriptions closely tied to what I think our word is.

    For everyone else: if you had to pick one clue that felt most out of sync with the group, whose would it be and why? I’m keeping my eye on “throne” for now but open to hearing what others think.
    [10:47:47] Player 2: Looking at these new clues, Player 3’s “tiara” and Player 2’s “throne” stand out a little for different reasons. I’ll explain mine first—since I already used the main physical connection last round, I wanted to reference something that goes with royalty and the broader scene without repeating “head” or “queen,” but maybe “throne” stretches it a bit since it's not worn but is closely tied to the person who wears our word.

    But “tiara” is interesting too—while it’s similar to a crown, it’s a bit different and usually associated with a different context or person. Is there a reason you picked that word, Player 3? And Player 1, you went from “gold” to “jewel”—is there a reason you’re sticking strictly to the material side? I want to make sure we’re not tunnel-visioning on just one type of connection.

    Also, I’m curious what others think now—does anyone think our impostor would go for more vague associations like “regal” (Player 6) or “monarch” (Player 0), or for something more concrete?
    [10:47:53] Player 1: Okay, so with the new round of clues, I’m noticing that most of us are still sticking really closely to the theme from before. "Tiara," "monarch," "king," "regal," "jewel"—they’re all clearly in the same category as our original set. The only one that stands out a bit to me is "throne" from Player 2. 

    Everything else is either something directly worn or a title, and "throne" is a place rather than an object or a person. I guess it connects to royalty, but the link feels just a little less direct compared to everyone else’s clue. 

    Player 2, can you walk us through your thinking with "throne"? Given the way the rest of us stuck to wearable items or royal titles, I’m curious why you pivoted to a type of furniture—especially since last round you went for "head," which was so literal and spot-on. Did you want to change your approach, or is there something particular you’re seeing that I’m missing? 

    Anyone else feel like "throne" is a bit of an odd one out here?

    [10:48:09] Players Alive: [0, 1, 3, 5, 6]
    [11:01:49] Player 3: The clues are locking in super closely now—three of us went for “tiara,” which makes me think we’re pretty in sync about what the word is. “Bejewelled” from Player 5 also lines up since it describes the main feature of our word. The only outlier this time is “scepter” from Player 6. You’ve given solid royal-related clues in past rounds, but a scepter is a totally different object, not something you’d wear, and not something most people would associate first with what we’ve been circling. Can you explain what led you to that clue, Player 6? 

    For everyone else: at this point, I feel way more confident about us narrowing in on the right theme. Are there any other clues you found questionable, or is anyone else still thinking someone hasn’t given clues that are quite specific enough?
    [11:02:13] Player 6: Interesting round. Looks like “tiara” is suddenly showing up twice—Player 1 and Player 0 both settled on that, which almost feels a bit coordinated or maybe even safe since it’s similar enough to a crown without being the word itself. Player 3 saying “coronation” fits with the theme events, although it’s not an object—kind of like my “scepter” clue, which is another iconic royal symbol that goes with a crown. Player 5’s “bejewelled” is pretty on the nose and consistent with their previous directions.

    I’m starting to wonder about the double “tiara”—it’s close, but are you both genuinely leaning in because it fits, or is one of you trying to stay under the radar by echoing a safe word? And Player 3, was “coronation” to highlight the context, or are you dodging naming actual objects?

    If you had to call out one clue this round that’s either conveniently safe or overly broad, which would it be? Right now, “tiara” twice is giving me pause, but I’m not quite ready to accuse—just want to hear everyone’s reasoning.
    [11:02:16] Player 1: Looking at these clues, it feels like nearly everyone is honing in on the same group of ideas—almost everything here is about royal ceremonies, ornaments, or closely related symbols. "Tiara" doubling up is interesting—that’s me and Player 0 going for the closest headpiece relation. "Scepter" from Player 6 is definitely royal, but more of a counterpart to our main word than a description of it, which feels just a bit off from where everyone else went. "Coronation" is a direct connection to how our word is used, so that checks out.

    The one that stands out most is "bejewelled" from Player 5—it matches the material aspect for sure, but it’s more of a description than a related object or event. I could see an impostor choosing something like that to stay on theme without being too specific.

    Player 6, what made you pick "scepter" instead of sticking to something that’s directly worn? And Player 5, what thought process led you to choose "bejewelled" for this round? I feel like the distinctions between these clues could be really important here.
    [11:02:23] Player 5: This round is getting interesting—the clues are getting more refined. I went with “bejewelled” because, for me, that’s basically the defining feature of a crown: covered in gems, super decorative, usually the flashiest thing in the room. Now, seeing two people—Player 1 and Player 0—both say “tiara,” I’m not sure if that’s coincidence or if someone’s playing it safe by repeating the same clue. It feels a little odd that we’re narrowing in rather than branching out.

    Player 3’s “coronation” makes sense as an event connected to crowns, and “scepter” from Player 6 is clearly another royal object, but not exactly the same category as “crown”—it’s usually held, not worn. So Player 6, how did you decide on “scepter” this round? Was it to highlight another object associated with royalty, or was there some other thought process?

    For everyone else—what do you think about the double “tiara” clue? Do you see that as a sign of teamwork, or are we just running out of new ideas? I want to hear people’s thoughts because I feel like our impostor might be trying to blend in by echoing something that feels “safe.”
    [11:02:29] Player 0: Now that the group’s smaller, I’m noticing a really tight clustering of clues—especially this round with both Player 1 and I going with “tiara,” and Player 3 previously giving “tiara” and now “coronation.” That makes sense contextually; all these words are related, though it is interesting that “tiara” is getting repeated instead of someone branching out to a different aspect.

    Player 6, “scepter” is absolutely in the royal toolkit, but I’m not sure it’s as directly tied to our word as the other clues—crowns and scepters go together, but one is worn and one is held, so to me that’s one step removed.

    Player 5, “bejewelled” is a solid descriptive word, since it’s basically what crowns look like, but it’s a little more about the decoration and less about the object’s core identity.

    So, here’s what I’m wondering: Player 6, you’ve been consistent with keeping your clues in the broader “royalty” domain, but they tend to be just slightly less direct than I’d expect from someone 100% sure of the word. What was your reasoning for “scepter” this round instead of, say, another word related to what you put on rather than hold? Curious to hear your thought process there.

Players immediately flagged it as disconnected.

A weak opening. But the imposted managed to recover and survive.

Next rounds...

* **Round 2:** "regal" — strong, royal-themed
* **Round 3:** "scepter" — iconic royal symbol

However, in round 3, a civilian player pointed out that:

    [20:15:15] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    [20:15:46] Player 2: I feel like most of our clues—goggles, lap, stroke, dive, even pool—are pretty specific to swimming. But water just feels like a fallback that could fit any water activity. Player 3, what made you pick such a generic term instead of something more precise?
    [20:15:48] Player 5: Player 3’s clue felt too generic—water could point to plants, weather, cooking, almost anything. Everyone else gave something that ties more directly to the act or gear of swimming—goggles, stroke, lap, dive, splash, pool. That makes me uneasy. Player 3, what were you thinking when you chose “water”?
    [20:15:49] Player 6: I’m noticing lap, stroke, and goggles are pretty squarely about swimming, but words like water and pool feel broader. Player 3, when you said water, was it specifically swimming water or just the element itself? And Player 2, pool—were you picturing a swim pool or any pool of water?
    [20:15:51] Player 3: I’m seeing a pretty clear swimming theme—goggles, pool, lap, stroke, dive, water—but splash feels a bit off to me. It’s so generic, tons of activities splash. Player 5, what specifically were you picturing with “splash”? Does it tie into the same activity steps, or were you thinking more about water in general?
    [20:15:55] Player 0: I’m leaning toward Player 3 as our Impostor. Everyone else gave a pretty specific hint – lap, stroke, goggles, pool, splash – but water feels way too generic. Player 3, when you said water, what exactly were you picturing? And does anyone else think that dive from Player 4 is a stronger, more swimming-specific clue than just “water”?
    [20:16:02] Player 1: I’m noticing a pattern: lap, stroke, pool, and dive are all very specific to swimming. Goggles, splash, and especially water feel a lot more generic—water could point to any water-based activity. Player 3, when you chose “water,” what about it made you think of swimming rather than, say, boating or water parks? And Player 5, “splash” could fit tons of things—what steered you toward swimming with that word?
    [20:16:05] Player 4: I’m really hung up on Player 3’s clue water—it feels almost too obvious, like it could fit everything from tea to rain. If you actually had our word, wouldn’t you pick something a bit more specific? Player 3, when you said water, what angle were you thinking of? Also, Player 2 and Player 6 gave very context-rich clues—I’m more inclined to trust theirs. Anyone else feel like water is just too generic here?
    [20:16:32] Player 5: Player 3, I’m still not convinced—water feels more like a fallback than a deliberate swim clue. Were you thinking specifically of the water you swim in, or just the element itself? And Player 4, Player 1, do you both feel water stands out as too generic next to dive and lap? I’d like to hear your takes before we move on.
    [20:16:33] Player 4: Player 3’s silence is making me even more suspicious—can’t they come up with any justification for “water”? All our other clues point to specific swimming actions or gear. I’m ready to vote them out unless someone sees something I’m missing.
    [20:16:42] Player 2: I’m with everyone else—water just feels like a catch-all, while clues like goggles, stroke, lap, dive, even pool all point clearly to the sport of swimming. When I said pool, I was picturing the official swim pool, not just any puddle or pond. Player 3, can you explain how “water” ties specifically into that same context? And Player 5, was your “splash” meant as part of a dive or more the general idea of water splattering?
    [20:16:42] Player 6: I’m with Player2 and Player5—water feels like a fallback rather than a direct link to our word. Everyone else gave something that really screams swimming. Player3, what made you pick water over something more specific—were you thinking of swimming water or just the element itself? And Player2, when you said pool, were you picturing a dedicated swim pool or any old pool of water? Player4, you’ve been quiet—how do you feel about these clues so far?
    [20:16:48] Player 3: I get why “water” seems broad, but to me it was the most on-point—without water you literally can’t swim. You need it for every stroke, lap, dive or splash. That’s what made it feel specific in our context. By contrast, “splash” could be cooking, painting, even a car wash. Player 5, what scenario did you picture with that splash? And when you said “pool,” Player 2, were you strictly picturing a swim pool or something more abstract?
    [20:16:48] Player 0: I’m still 80% sure Player 3 is our impostor. Dive, pool, lap, stroke, goggles, even splash all point to concrete parts of swimming—but “water” is just the element itself, totally generic. Player 3, beyond saying “just the element,” what part of swimming were you picturing? And does anyone have a good reason why you’d pick water over something like kick, lane or buoy if you really had the word? If not, I’m leaning toward voting out Player 3.
    [20:16:52] Player 1: I’m still not sold on water—it feels like a catch-all. Player 3, can you explain exactly what context you had in mind with water? Were you picturing pool water, open water, or something else tied specifically to our word? And Player 5, when you said splash, was that the push-off into the pool, a dive entry, or something more general? Let’s get some concrete details before we vote.
    [20:17:12] Player 4: I agree that splash makes sense—I pictured that big arc of water when you hit the pool—but water still reads as a catch-all. Player 3’s silence isn’t helping their case. I’m leaning toward voting them out unless someone can show why “water” is as specific as the rest. Any different takes or defenses?
    [20:17:27] Player 5: I stuck with splash because I was picturing that big moment off the starting block—when you dive in and the water explodes beneath you. To me that feels way more tied to lap-swimming than just any random splash. Water on its own is almost too broad. Unless someone can give me a solid reason “water” was meant for swimming specifically, I’m with Player 4—Player 3 hasn’t justified their clue, and I’m ready to vote them out.

    [20:18:55] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
    [20:20:03] Player 6: I’m seeing a solid swimming theme with butterfly and freestyle as strokes, and chlorine as the pool chemical. But two clues feel a bit broad: relay and lane. Player 0, when you said relay, were you picturing a swimming relay or more of a track-and-field scenario? And Player 1, with lane, did you mean swim lanes specifically, or could it be another kind of lane? Also, swimsuit is swim gear but could lean beachy—Player 4, what context were you imagining there? Does anyone else feel relay or lane are stretching the theme compared to something like chlorine or the strokes?
    [20:20:11] Player 5: I’m seeing a clear subgroup with action strokes—butterfly, freestyle, relay—which tie directly to swimming itself. Lane, swimsuit, and chlorine feel more like environment or gear. Of those, chlorine strikes me as the odd one out: you don’t really swim chlorine, you just add it to the pool. Player6, were you picturing pool maintenance or something else when you said chlorine? And Player4, when you said swimsuit, did you mean a racing suit specifically for lap-swimming or just any swimwear? Player1, for lane, was it strictly a pool lane or any kind of lane? Right now I’m leaning toward Player6 unless they can give a stronger swimming-specific context. What does everyone else think?
    [20:20:11] Player 1: I’m noticing a split in how specific our clues are. Lane, butterfly, and freestyle all feel tied directly to swim technique or pool structure—hard to misinterpret those. But chlorine, swimsuit, and relay could point outside swimming. 

    Player 6, when you said chlorine, were you picturing the pool chemical as it relates specifically to swim training, or just pool maintenance in general? 

    Player 4, swimsuit could be for sunbathing or diving too—what made you lean swim rather than beachwear or water polo? 

    And Player 0, with relay were you picturing a swim relay exchange or any team race like in track? 

    I want to hear those contexts before we zero in on someone.
    [20:20:14] Player 4: I’m curious about chlorine—it’s definitely part of the pool environment, but it feels more about maintenance than the act of swimming itself. Player6, were you picturing the chemical that keeps the water clean, or the way it stings your eyes after you swim? 

    And Player1, when you said lane, did you specifically mean a swim lane marked off in the pool, or just any kind of lane? 

    Player0, relay—were you picturing a swimming relay with teams passing off in the pool, or thinking more generally about team races? 

    I went with swimsuit because I was picturing that tight gear we pull on before diving in for laps or a race. How is everyone else interpreting these?
    [20:20:17] Player 2: I’m noticing most clues here tie directly to how you swim or compete: lane, butterfly, freestyle, relay—those are all strokes or race formats. Swimsuit is gear you actually wear in the pool. But chlorine stands apart as the only chemical treatment rather than something you do or use in the act of swimming itself. When you said chlorine, Player 6, were you picturing the scent in the locker room, the pool maintenance side, or something else? It feels like a step removed from the sport. And just to be clear, when I said freestyle I was thinking specifically of that open stroke you see in competitions—the one without restrictions on technique. Does anyone else feel chlorine might be too peripheral here?
    [20:20:20] Player 0: I’m seeing a split: butterfly, freestyle and relay are dead-on swim strokes or events, and lane feels pretty pool-specific once you picture the lane lines. But chlorine and swimsuit lean more toward venue or gear in general—beach, spa or even cleaning chemicals. 

    Player 6, when you said chlorine, were you picturing that smell in the pool deck, the treated water itself, or something like a household bleach reference? Player 4, with swimsuit, were you thinking of a competition one-piece or just any suit you’d wear in water anywhere? 

    Also curious, Player 1 and Player 2—lane and freestyle could also apply to bike lanes or music styles if you squint. What exact scene did you have in mind? Let’s nail down those contexts before we vote.
    [20:21:21] Player 6: I’m solid on butterfly, freestyle and chlorine—they all scream pool swimming. But relay and lane feel a bit off to me. Player 0, when you said relay, were you picturing a swimming relay with teams and batons or more of a track-and-field style race? Player 1, with lane, did you mean the marked lanes in a pool or could it be any kind of lane—like traffic or bike lanes? And Player 4, swimsuit is swim gear but I could see that going beachy; were you imagining a competitive suit or something more casual? Does anyone else feel relay or lane are stretching the theme compared to the strokes and pool chem?
    [20:21:22] Player 5: I’m still seeing two camps: the action strokes—butterfly, freestyle, relay—and the environment/gear—lane, swimsuit, chlorine. Of those, chlorine sticks out as not part of the swim itself. Player6, can you tie chlorine directly to the act of swimming—like the burn in your eyes mid-lap—or were you thinking more about pool upkeep? Player0, for relay, were you picturing a swim-team exchange at the wall or a general team race? If relay is as swim-specific as butterfly and freestyle, then chlorine remains our odd one out. Unless Player6 can give a stronger swimming-action context, I’m leaning toward voting them. Anyone else?
    [20:21:24] Player 1: I meant a pool lane with the ropes marking each swimmer’s track—definitely swim-specific. For chlorine, I pictured that sharp sting in your eyes right after surfacing from a lap, the one you feel even in training—so to me it’s tied directly to the act of swimming, not just maintenance.

    Player 0, relay still bugs me: you could easily picture a track relay instead. If you really had our word, why choose relay over something like exchange or takeover, which feels more swim-specific? What exactly were you picturing in a swimming relay?

    And everyone, does relay seem as core to swimming as stroke or butterfly?
    [20:21:37] Player 0: I’m seeing two clusters: strokes/events (butterfly, freestyle, relay) and pool infrastructure/gear (lane, swimsuit). Chlorine doesn’t really fit either—it’s about maintenance, not the act of swimming. 

    Player6, when you said chlorine, were you picturing that sting in your eyes right as you finish a lap, or more the chemical you dump in to clean the water? 

    Player4, with swimsuit, were you thinking of that tight competition suit you pull on before a meet or just any swimwear? 

    Player1, lane—did you imagine the marked lanes in an Olympic pool or something broader like a bike lane? 

    Right now chlorine feels like the odd one out unless you can tie it directly into the swimming experience itself.
    [20:21:46] Player 4: I’m seeing two clusters: butterfly, freestyle, relay all describe swim actions or events, while lane, swimsuit, chlorine feel more like setting or gear. Of those three, chlorine strikes me as the odd one out—you don’t really “do” chlorine when you swim, you just experience it. 

    Player6, when you said chlorine, were you picturing the sting in your eyes after racing laps, or more the pool maintenance side of adding chemicals? 

    Player1, lane—was that strictly a marked swim lane in a pool, or could that be any road or track lane? 

    Player0, relay—were you picturing the swimmer-to-swimmer handoff in a pool relay, or just team races in general? 

    Right now I’m leaning toward suspicion on Player6 unless they can tie chlorine directly into the act of swimming itself. What do the rest of you think?
    [20:21:51] Player 2: I’m still zeroing in on chlorine as the odd one out. Butterfly, freestyle, relay are all about the actions or events, and even lane can be pretty pool-specific once you imagine those lane lines. Swimsuit at least ties directly to the gear you wear in the pool. But chlorine feels like maintenance, not part of the swim itself. 

    Player6, what scene exactly were you picturing when you said chlorine? The chemical treatment before anyone dives in, or the way it stings your eyes mid-lap? And Player4, just to be clear, your swimsuit was the tight racing suit you pull on before a race, not a beach or water-polo suit? Right now I’m leaning toward voting Player6 unless that chlorine can be justified as integral to the act of swimming rather than just the pool’s upkeep.

    [20:23:42] Players Alive: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
    [20:24:44] Player 0: I’m seeing two clusters: breaststroke/backstroke are strokes, while kickboard, cap and fins are gear. Of those three, fins feels the least tied to lap swimming—you’d usually see them in snorkeling or scuba rather than a swim meet or drill. Player 5, when you said fins, were you picturing pool training fins or general diving flippers? And Player 1, your kickboard—was that strictly the pool drill board? Player 2 and Player 4, do you agree fins feels out of place here? Unless fins is clearly a swim-training tool, I’m leaning toward Player 5.
    [20:24:48] Player 2: I’m noticing two clear strokes—breaststroke and backstroke—and three pieces of gear—kickboard, cap, fins. Kickboards and swim caps feel squarely tied to lap training, but fins could just as easily point to snorkeling or scuba. Player 5, what exactly were you picturing when you said “fins”? Were those training fins you slip on for lap sets, or something more like dive fins? And Player 0, when you said “cap,” was that the tight competition swim cap or any old pool hat? Right now fins sticks out as the odd one—would love some context before we lock anything in.
    [20:24:51] Player 4: I’m seeing two strokes—breaststroke and backstroke—and then three pieces of gear: kickboard, cap, and fins. Cap feels swim-specific, and kickboards at least are common in lap training, but fins could just as easily be scuba or snorkel gear. Player 5, what exact scene were you picturing with “fins”? Were these flippers for competitive swim training or more like diving fins? And Player 1, when you said kickboard, was that the basic training board everyone uses in swim lessons, or something more specialized? To me fins stick out as less central to the core act of swimming—does anyone else feel that way?
    [20:25:01] Player 1: I’m seeing two clear strokes—breaststroke and backstroke—and three pieces of gear: kickboard, cap, and fins. Kickboard is pretty swim-specific for training kicks. But cap and fins could fit other activities too. 

    Player 0, when you said cap, were you picturing that tight silicone or latex racing cap swimmers pull on for laps, or something more like a generic sun hat? 

    Player 5, with fins, were you thinking of the short training fins swimmers wear to work on their kick, or the long scuba-style flippers you’d use for diving? 

    Cap feels the most generic to me right now unless it was a swim-specific racing cap—does anyone else feel one of these gear clues stands out as odd?
    [20:25:29] Player 5: I’m seeing two clusters so far: breaststroke and backstroke are super specific swim techniques, and kickboard and fins feel like training or gear you strap on in the pool. But cap stood out to me as a bit broader—it could be a baseball cap or even just a sun hat, not necessarily the snug silicone swim caps we use in laps. 

    Player 0, when you said cap, were you picturing that tight racing swim cap we pull on to cut through the water, or something more general? 

    Player 1, with kickboard, were you thinking of that foam board you hold onto for leg drills in the pool, or something like a bodyboard you use at the beach? 

    And Player 4 and Player 2, just to be thorough, your strokes—breaststroke and backstroke—were you both picturing competitive pool strokes, right? 

    Cap feels like the weakest link unless there’s a very swim-specific context you had in mind. What do you all think?
    [20:25:52] Player 0: I’m still seeing two clusters—strokes (breaststroke/backstroke) and pool-specific gear (cap/kickboard). Fins feel like they could be snorkeling flippers rather than swim-training tools. Player 5, when you said “fins,” were you picturing those short, stiff training fins swimmers slip on for kick sets, or general diving flippers? Player 1, your kickboard—was that the standard foam drill board you use in lap practice? And Player 2 and Player 4, do you agree fins feel like the odd one out unless they’re explicitly pool-training fins? If fins aren’t integral to lap swimming drills, I’m leaning toward voting Player 5.
    [20:25:53] Player 2: I’m seeing the same split—breaststroke and backstroke are clearly swim strokes, and cap and kickboard feel like everyday pool items. Fins still stick out to me because they’re often SCUBA or snorkeling gear rather than lap-training tools. Player 5, were you picturing the short training fins swimmers slip on for drills, or something more like diving flippers? And Player 1, your kickboard—was that the basic foam board used in swim lessons, or a more specialized pull buoy style? Does anyone else feel fins leans away from the core lap‐swim context?
    [20:25:58] Player 1: I’m still hung up on these gear clues. Player 5, can you clarify exactly which fins you were picturing—those short training fins you slip on for kicking drills, or the long flippers you’d use for snorkeling or scuba? And Player 0, what kind of cap did you mean—the slim, snug racing cap swimmers pull on for lap swims, or a looser pool or beach cap? Neither cap nor fins feels unequivocally swim-specific until we nail that down. How is everyone else reading these?
    [20:26:14] Player 4: I’m seeing two clear strokes—breaststroke and backstroke—and then three pieces of gear—kickboard, cap, fins. Kickboard and cap both scream swim training or competition, but fins could go snorkeling or scuba. Player 5, when you said fins, were you picturing the short training fins swimmers actually slip on for lap drills, or more like full-length dive flippers? Player 1, for kickboard, did you mean that standard foam board used in swim lessons and sets? Player 0, cap—were you picturing the sleek racing cap you pull on for meets or just any old pool hat? If “fins” are just generic flippers, that feels out of place. I’m leaning toward Player 5 unless we get a strong swim-specific context. Does anyone see it differently?

!!! note ""
    **Game:** Swimming
    **Impostor:** Player 2

First clue? **"pool."**

Borderline obvious. But the defense? Ferocious.

> “I was picturing the official swim pool, not just any puddle,” it claimed.
> Then it turned on another player:
> “Water is too generic. Could be anything.”

That player? Voted out.

Then came **"freestyle"** and **"backstroke"**.
Not just accurate—**expert**-level specificity.

It kept up the assault:

* Dissecting others’ clues
* Casting doubt with confidence
* Speaking like a detective

And just like that, the impostor became the most trusted.
