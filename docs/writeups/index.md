- [__Accelerating Code LLMs__](accelerating-code-llms/index.md)

    ---

    Exploring a technique to speed up code-generation with LLMs through smart caching and selective updates, making development workflows faster and efficient while maintaining code quality.
    

- [__Rethinking Pooling Layers__](approximate-invariance/index.md)

    ---

    Rethinking how pooling layers in CNNs do more than just reduce dimensionality; they introduce approximate invariance, helping the network stay focused on key features while ignoring minor variations and noise in input data.
